    <h1>Hello, CSS</h1>

    <p>CSS lets us style HTML elements. Thereâ€™s also
       <a href='dummy.html'>another page</a> associated with this example.</p>

    <h2>List Styles</h2>

    <p>You can style unordered lists with the following bullets:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>disc</li>
      <li>circle</li>
      <li>square</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And you can number ordered lists with the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>decimal</li>
      <li>lower-roman</li>
      <li>upper-roman</li>
      <li>lower-alpha</li>
      <li>upper-alpha</li>
      <li>(and many more!)</li>
    </ol>
  </body>

Let's Try Some Inline Elements

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

Images 
Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
If you build this page right, your images will form a small "carousel"
